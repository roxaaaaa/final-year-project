Once released on a farm, the dock beetle breeds to colonise the whole field. Dock beetles are native and natural predators of docks. They skeletonise dock leaves grassland. The population of dock beetle will initially rise to decimate the dock weed naturally. The population will reduce as its success diminishes its natural food supply in a sustainable way on an annual basis. They hibernate for the winter and reappear each spring.

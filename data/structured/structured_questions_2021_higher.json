UCD trials indicate increased ewe milk production and lamb weight gain in flocks grazing multi‐species swards The definition of multi‐species, is a mixture composed of two or more species, consisting of grasses (e.g. perennial ryegrass and timothy), herbs (e.g. chicory and plantain) and legumes (e.g. white and red clover) used in grazing mixtures. The different species bring a range of benefits to the sward. The main challenges with multi‐species swards include ensuring persistency of the herbs and to a lesser extent, the legumes in the sward. Blanket herbicide application is not possible post‐emergence as any herbicide that will kill broadleaf weeds will also kill the herbs, and finally establishment can be challenging particularly in the autumn.

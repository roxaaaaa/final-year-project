(ii) In relation to environmental sustainability, briefly describe the advantages of one other named piece of farm technology you have studied. Named technology: Or (b) Read the article and the questions that follow. Slurry System Technology that Reduces Ammonia Emissions EASYFIX was awarded the first Green Impact Award for its pioneering technology designed to reduce methane and ammonia emissions from slurry storage at the 2024 National Ploughing Championship. The system injects compressed oxygen into the slurry at specific points via non-return valves. The oxygen that flows through the valve creates a bubble and as it rises through the slurry it helps to break the slurry down and ensures that it remains in a liquid state. The benefit of this technology is that it is proven to reduce ammonia emissions by up to 51%. It also greatly assists in the increased availability of nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) in the slurry. The liquid state of the slurry eliminates the need for agitation. (Adapted from enterpriseireland.ie, 2024) (i) Briefly explain how the use of this technology could be safer for (1) animals and (2) the environment. Animals: Environment: (ii) Apart from safety, outline ways this technology could benefit farmers."

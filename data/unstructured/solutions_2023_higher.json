Fleckvieh Cattle This Austrian breed is renowned for exceptional fertility, longevity, calving ease, a low somatic cell count, strong feet, and overall good health traits. This breed reportedly milks roughly 6,000kg in their first lactation and over 7,000kg in their later lactations. They have an estimated milk fat of 4.2% and protein of 3.7%.

    "text": "Question 9 either (a) or (b). (a) Read the article and the questions which follow. The Farmdroid has landed in Ireland The Farmdroid, which won the National Ploughing Championship 2022 machine of the year is a fully functioning solar powered field vehicle that automates sowing and mechanical weeding. The core principle of the machine is that it relies on GPS location data to go about its daily tasks. The tasks of sowing and mechanical weed control in crops are guided by precision GPS. Using this GPS, the Farmdroid can sow the seeds far enough apart to note and record where each individual seed has been planted in a field. The company claims that accuracy is to within 8mm, allowing even pre-emergence hoeing of the soil both between the rows and in between the plants themselves in most crops. (Adapted from Agriland, 2022) (i) Explain the underlined term. (ii) Explain how the Farmdroid can benefit the environment and the farmer. (iii) Apart from GPS, outline one piece of technology that you have studied that would benefit both the farmer and the environment. Or (b) Scanning female animals to determine if they are pregnant is an important job that is carried out on farms. (i) Briefly describe the benefits of pregnancy scanning in animals.

Direct drilling: Advantage: (b) He planted three fields of winter oilseed rape in mid- August, using a different variety in each of the three fields. It was undersown with Berseem clover at a rate of 1.6kg/ha as a companion crop. Applying your knowledge of crop production, the questions which follow.

(iv) Berseem clover is an annual plant. Explain the underlined term. (v) Give another example of an annual plant that you have studied. (c) Read the following extract and the questions which follow. An easy tool to examine successful plant establishment is using a plant count. Calculating % establishment can help to examine if sowing conditions were appropriate and what can (Adapted from Farmers Journal, 2022) (i) Describe how to carry out a plant count in a 2 hectare field. (ii) Briefly explain advantages of carrying out a plant count in a newly sown or reseeded field. (iii) Plants counts are easiest to carry out when plants are at the one to two leaf stage. When plants start to tiller out, it becomes very difficult to count them. Explain why it becomes difficult to count the plants at this stage. (iv) Teagasc recommends a seeding rate of 350 seeds/m2 to establish 300 plants/m2. expected establishment rate."

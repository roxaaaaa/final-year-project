    "text": "Question 9 either (a) or (b). (a) (i) Draw a labelled diagram of a calf’s stomach in its first week of life. (ii) Describe how the calf’s stomach in part (i) above differs from an adult ruminant stomach. Or (b) Read the article on the SEASOLUTIONS Project and the questions which follow. SEASOLUTIONS PROJECT Reducing methane emissions from ruminants is one of the biggest challenges to face the agricultural sector in the last decade. The SEASOLUTIONS Project is committed to making a positive impact on methane emissions in agriculture. By using seaweeds and seaweed derived ingredients to positively affect the rumen and rumen microbiota to reduce methane emissions and improve ruminant health. By adding seaweed components to the feed of sheep and cattle indoors on high grain based diets, Irish researchers have reduced methane production by 20%. A critical aspect of this project is to test such seaweed supplements within the context of a pasture‐based production system. (Adapted from SEASOLUTIONS.ie and Teagasc, 2021) (i) Outline two roles of micro‐organisms in the ruminant stomach. 1. 2. (ii) Describe why is it critical for the researchers to test the seaweed supplements stated above within the context of a pasture‐based production system. (iii) Meat samples will also be collected as part of the trial to ensure the seaweed or seaweed extracts have no effect on meat quality. Outline why this aspect of the trial is important."

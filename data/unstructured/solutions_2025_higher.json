    "solution": "Q3 (a)(i) Outline reasons why farmers install cow brushes in cattle sheds. Allow cows to groom or scratch / reduce skin irritations / reduce stress or improved animal welfare / encourage natural behaviour / 3+3 cleaner cows or improved hygiene (for animal) / improved blood circulation (ii) Describe the advantages of one other named piece of farm technology in relation to environmental sustainability. 3+1 Two points on any named valid piece of technology relating to environmental sustainability OR (b)(i) Briefly explain how this technology would be safer for (1) animals and (2) the environment. Animals: Less risk to animals from noxious (harmful) gases 4+1 Environment: Reduction of greenhouse gases (which contribute to air pollution) / reduced runoff due to increased nutrient absorption by plants (ii) Apart from safety, outline ways this technology could benefit farmers. labour is reduced (as there is no need to agitate or move animals) / (as slurry is liquid) less blockages occur to equipment"

Progeny testing To assess the genetic merit (traits or characteristics) of a breeding animal through their offspring (b) Having a buffer zone close to a waterway. Reduce run off or prevent eutrophication / reduce sediment in rivers / increased bank stability / increased biodiversity 2(4)+ (c) Presence of chloroplasts in the palisade layer of a leaf. 2(1) Close to surface to maximise photosynthesis (d) Culling of breeding ewes on a sheep farm. Ewe could be lame or infertile or diseased or prevent undesirable traits (so is not suitable for breeding) (e) Movement of water from the soil through the plant to the atmosphere. To transport minerals / to provide water for photosynthesis / to cool the plant 17 any 4 questions"

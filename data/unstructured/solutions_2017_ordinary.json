The pure‐breeding barley variety Beta (BB) has a straw length of 600 mm. A cross between these two varieties results in a hybrid with a straw length of 700 mm. (i) What does this show about the genes that control straw length in this example? (ii) Copy and complete the following in your book to show the cross between the Alpha and Beta varieties of barley. Parents: Pure‐breeding Alpha X Pure‐breeding Beta Genotypes of parents: ( ) X ( ) Gametes: ( ) X ( ) Genotype of offspring: ( ) Phenotype of hybrid offspring: _____________________ (iii) The hybrid plants were allowed to self‐pollinate and the resulting seeds were sown. Copy and complete the following in your book, using the above hybrids as parents. Genotype of parents: ( ) X ( ) Gametes: ( ) ( ) X ( ) ( ) Genotypes of offspring: ( ) ( ) ( ) Phenotypes of offspring: ________________ _________________ _________________ (c) (i) State one advantage of using artificial insemination (AI) on a dairy farm. (ii) State one disadvantage of using AI on a dairy farm."
